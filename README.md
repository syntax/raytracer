# raytracer

following https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html as I have never done a computer graphics course, and also want to get better at cpp.

This is an initial projcet to get me back up to speed with cpp and then hopefully I will aim to do something a bit more off the beaten track.


to build (following `mkdir build` if not already):

```bash
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```
